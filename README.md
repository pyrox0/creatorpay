## Contributing
We'd love your help! Feel free to propose adding a feature you'd like on the issues page, and if it's accepted, 
you can work alone or with others to craft that feature perfectly, then send in a PR! We'll review it, and if 
the code looks good, it's merged!

### Feature Consideration
The way we select features is based on whether they will be useful. We want to make a simple platform, without adding 
every feature under the sun. Therefore, things that make the platform significantly more complicated may not be accepted. 
But no matter what the feature suggestion, we don't know you want it if you don't speak up! So please, open a feature request, 
no matter how big or small the feature is! As a community project, it's always heartwarming to get a feature request!
